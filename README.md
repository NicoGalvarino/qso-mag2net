# qso-mag2net

qso-mag2net model from the paper "The BarYon CYCLE Project (ByCycle): Identifying and Localizing MgII Metal Absorbers with Machine Learning"

The paper itself can be found in ByCycle_ML_paper.pdf

A downloadlink to the qso-mag2net_model can be found in qso-mag2net_model/download_link.txt
An example of the model training can be found in qso-mag2net_model/qso-mag2net_model_example
  Documentation for this is currently a bit sparse and code not the prettiest. Will be updated at a later point but should do for now.
